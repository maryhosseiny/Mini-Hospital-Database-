# My Personal Project
## Project Description

This *project description* addresses the following questions:
- What will the application do?
- Who will use this application?
- Why is this project of interest to me?

My project is a hospital database application where the user can perform various tasks.
This includes features such as viewing the hospital staff names and their ids, adding or removing
a patient to the hospital database, viewing a patient's information, and viewing the patients
that are discharged from the hospital. The hospital database also includes a medication 
section, where the user can see a medication's name, serial number and brand. The user 
is also provided with the feature of adding and removing medication from the hospital
database. This application can be used by high school students in order for them to understand 
how a hospital database operates and what features it includes. This application specifically
focuses on introducing high school students to the basics of user info within the medical
field as well as some basic operations that are used on a daily basis in a hospital. This project 
is an interest mine since I've actively worked with different patient databases where I was able 
to gain more knowledge and insight as to how real life database applications operate. Hence, why I 
thought being able to recreate a smaller, more compact version of these application would
be a good idea.
