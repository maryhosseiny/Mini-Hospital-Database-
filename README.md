# My Personal Project
## Project Description

This *project description* addresses the following questions:
- What will the application do?
- Who will use this application?
- Why is this project of interest to me?

My project is a game application is called **The Mining Stimulator**. It 
consists of a main character, the miner, working in a mine trying to collect
as much money as possible. His main goal is to collect as many gold pieces, 
diamonds and treasure chests as possible. The miner's only tool is a single
claw that is swinging back and forth. Pressing the space key will allow the 
player to grab their desired item while mining. Once the space key is 
pressed, the claw will lock at the angle it was moving in and shoot 
forward to grab the first object in its way. Objects such as rocks, 
TNT barrels and random animals will be placed in random location to 
increase the difficulty of the game. The player has to reach a certain 
amount of gold before it can move onto the next level. The users ca be 
of any age but the main focus is teens and individuals in their early
adulthood stage. Due to the simplicity of the game, I believe that these
two groups would enjoy the game the most. The main reason why I was 
interested in creating this application is due to nostalgia.
I remember playing a similar game in my late childhood on the computer. 
Being able to recreate this game so that other individuals can also enjoy it
has become a new interest of mine.
