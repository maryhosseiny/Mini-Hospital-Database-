# My Personal Project
## Project Description

This *project description* addresses the following questions:
- What will the application do?
- Who will use this application?
- Why is this project of interest to me?

My project is a ToDo list application where the user can create their
own tasks and customize it to their liking. This includes features such
as adding a title, specifying the type of task, choosing a due date and
choosing between whether the task is completed or not. The user will have
the ability to update the status of the task as well as changing any
other property (ei. changing the due date of a task). The user will also
have the ability to view the number of incomplete and completed tasks.
This application can be used for individuals of any age group but the 
main focus group would be high school and university students as most
deal with a more diverse list of tasks in their day-to-day lives. This
project is an interest of mine since I use ToDo lists every day. It 
helps give shape to my day as well having a clear outline of tasks in
case I forget any. That is why creating this application is a topic 
of interest of mine.
